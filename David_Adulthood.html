<h1>Adulthood</h1>

<p><strong>My adulthood</strong> is when I started doing the things I really wanted to do because I joine the military. 
I was able to travel the world and I used the military as a stepping stone to get where I want to be in life. I served 
7 years and it was the greatest I did because it provides me with education benefits that I find important. 
I was stationed in Kansas most of my career, at first it was scary going there because I didnâ€™t know what to expect but 
I was able to make friends that I call family today. </p>
