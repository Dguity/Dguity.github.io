<h1>Childhood</h1>

<p><strong>My childhood</strong> was pretty rough and wasn’t easy. There were good times and bad times. 
I like to focus more on the good times, family was very important because that’s all I had. 
I grew up 4 other younger siblings and a single mother that raised us all. Financially things were not easy but as kids 
we always found a way to stay busy and be happy as kids because we didn’t value money. As I kid, I grew up doing the 
typical things that any young boy in NYC would be doing like playing in the park, playing video games, going to the 
recreation center, and riding bikes. We were mostly raised in New York but eventually moved to North Carolina when I 
got to High school.  </p>
